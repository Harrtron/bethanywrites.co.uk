### Itâ€™s time to talk about the kittens.

About four months ago, me and my boyfriend became parents â€“ to two adorable kittens.

Mine was inevitably going to be named after a Disney character. I pondered over Cinderella, debated over Belle and ummed and ahhed over Rapunzel (it would be unique, but in the eyes of many, confusing and cruel.)

Aurora seemed to be the perfect choice. Sleeping Beauty has truly grown into her name. She is a gorgeous black, brown and white tabby cat with Jupiter-sized eyes which mimic those of Shrekâ€™s Puss in Boots (no Spanish accent though unfortunately).

She is a diva (meaowing at impossible volumes at 4am for food (much like myself to be honest, ask Harley) but is easily forgiven when she struts over to the food dish and blinks innocently.

She is also a feline Princess (if anyone can recommend a sturdy non-chewable kitten sized tiara, please do).

And then, like in many Disney films, she has a sidekick.

Introducing, Lines. Lines is named after a Bristol Roversâ€™ footballer â€“ a 29-year-old who turned professional at Bristol Rovers, and made his first team debut in January 2006. (I so did NOT just Google that).

Fur-baby Lines (as known in our flat and across social media) is pretty talented with a football also (of the soft, cat-nip scented variety).

He is the (feline) man of the house; constantly playful, forever hungry and always found to be chasing his tail in the bathroom. For fun or for pure curiosity? We will never know.

Having kittens has been life-changing. There are responsibilities to remember â€“ litter, food, water-changing etc.

We have been through alot together, the Beth, Harley, Aurora and Lines crew.

De-fleaing the kittens was fun.

De-pooing the flat was another.

But there are also endless perks â€“ the cuddles, cute purrs and feeling of loyalty and love when they jump on your pillow after having eaten â€“ purely for attention and affection (or sometimes, just for more food, but we dismiss this concept).

They are the purrfect pets (had to be done).
