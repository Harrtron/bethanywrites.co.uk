Aurora and Lines have grown to have the most adorable and unique personalities. Theyâ€™re many things â€“ endearing, cuddly, fluffy and curious.

They can also be loud, irritating and annoying. But they redeem themselves on a minutely basis. Who could resist their childish whimpers and marble-sized eyes?

The latest hobby one troublemaker in particular has started to enjoy is stealing my hairbands.

Princess Aurora, who must have at least 20 different toys around the flat, seems to take pleasure in raiding my jewellery box and hiding the treasures inside.

Sheâ€™s very talented at choosing to do so at the most inconvenient time â€“ but again, after fuming, I find this endearing.

Itâ€™s cute how a tiny hair bobble, worth approximately 4p, can bring so much joy. Bulk buying hairbands would certainly be an investment into my, and Auroraâ€™s future.

But now I think her mischievous brother Lines is in on the trick.

At least three times a week, I find myself on my knees, searching for a hairband under the sofa. Itâ€™s all fun and games, until the spiders attack you along the way.

Hiding the washing up sponge is a different story.

It is no surprise to find a sponge near the front door at 7.30am, or again, under the sofa, at 6pm.

For some reason, the kittens have recently become fascinated with the washing up sponge and find it mandatory to hide it somewhere else nearly everyday.

I hope this will pass soon, or better yet, the kittens learn how to wash up so their hobby can become beneficial.

Sitting on top of the bathroom mirror and watching you shower is also a strange hobby for Lines.

The first time I turned around to find his face pressed up against the glass, peering into the shower, I nearly had a heart attack. Then I felt extremely self-conscious that I was being watched and found myself shooing him away in embarrassment.

Do other cats do this? Is this normal? Is it normal that I no longer care and I pray one day he will join in with my shower singing and beautifully harmonise?

Aurora hasnâ€™t quite mastered the leap of faith to the considerably high mirror. I hope she stays put for now.
