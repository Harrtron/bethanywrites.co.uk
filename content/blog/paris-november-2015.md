This month, I went to Paris for a week of fun, culture, cocktails and attempting to speak in French.

### C’était fantastique!

![1]

Myself and my boyfriend Harley had organised the holiday months ago, with two main attractions in mind. Firstly, one of his favourite music producers Zedd was on tour and we quickly bought tickets to see him at the Trianon Hall.

Secondly – my decade long obsession with the Moulin Rouge was about to become a reality. I first saw the film, starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor when I was about 12 years old, and over ten years on, it’s still my all time favourite. I still know every word to the Elephant Love Medley and find it hard to suppress my tears everytime I watch the film (if you haven’t seen it, stop what you’re doing – even reading this – and do so now.) Also, my Ford KA is called Satine. Obsession.

We were both extremely excited for the holiday, despite predicted weather of rain, rain, wind and more rain. Sadly though, the Parisian attacks took place earlier this month which resulted in Zedd cancelling his tour.

Watching the attacks on the news was terrifying and deeply upsetting. I had visited Paris before with family when I was much younger, and had studied French at A-Level due to loving the French culture. Paris is such a beautiful and peaceful city and it is disturbing that some disgusting people chose to try and destroy this while murdering innocent people.

A week after the tragedies in the city, we were due to leave for our holiday, and family and friends had mixed opinions on us travelling.

Obviously, it did cross my mind that perhaps we should cancel. But after much consideration, we decided that we should adhere to what we love about France – freedom.

We chose to go – and do not regret it at all!

We were welcomed into our hotel room to this wall-art, which was very moving – Paris will, indeed, always be Paris.

What followed was a week of exploring the city. Using a pretty awesome phone app, called Secrets De Paris, we stumbled across random but interesting ornaments and places, from modern art galleries to the Wall of Love –  a love-themed 40 square metres  wall in the Jehan Rictus garden square in Montmartre.

We were enticed to visit well-known Parisian landmarks – obviously the grand Tour d’eiffel and Notre Dame de Paris (this was particularly exciting as my love of the Disney film has also lived on for many years! I was half-hoping to bump into Esmerelda).

![3]

And then there was the Arc de Triomphe which I will forever remember as being a beautiful monument with the most dangerous roads alongside it meaning tourists were gambling with their lives to scarper through fast traffic. It was terrifying. We resorted in posing for a photo further back than the adrenalin-pumper dare-devils dodging between cars.

Considering our last (and first!) holiday was nine days of pure relaxation in Turkey, sipping cocktails from the pool in the scorching sun (and burning ridiculously on day one as a result, but that’s another story) our day at The Louvre was hugely cultural for us.

At first, we struggled getting into the museum. I don’t mean because of the heightened security – we genuinely could not find the entrance and with torrential rain and gale like winds (which combined to break the umbrella bought from a gift shop only 20 minutes before) we were close to giving up.

But finally, we found the weary rain-soaked queue and explored. Obviously, posing immaturely with many artefacts was a must.

Taking a selfie with Mona was also paramount. (By the way, they cleverly put her in the farthest room away from anywhere so you end up trekking for miles around the museum looking frantically for small arrowed signs with her teasing face).

As new explorers, finding the best bars and pubs was something we were both passionate about. Our first night in Paris was an unusual one. We stumbled across Dirty Dick, a dark, candlelit bar which served us a volcano cocktail which was set on fire. It was a great way to welcomed to the city.

We then pursued strange cocktail holders and drank out of a bathtub down the road. I must say, our drinks were fairly normal for the remainder of the holiday, but those were particularly exciting.

My favourite part of the holiday, HANDS DOWN, was our night at the Moulin Rouge. We did not just walk past and get a cheeky selfie. Oh no. I had waited far too long for this. We saw an extraordinary performance inside the Moulin Rouge with a bucket of champagne and it was amazing.

Lots of nudity (female only) but this was soon forgotten – an epic and mesmerising performance. Singing, dancing, dare-devil stunts and theatrical humour which entertained everyone – no matter what background or nationality.

I was also lucky enough to come away with a very shiny (and very expensive!) souvenir courtesy of my mon cheri (merci merci merci monsieur Harley!!).

Paris was loud, vibrant and exciting, and I do not believe anything can ever change that. Also, shout out to every bar having cocktail happy hour deals…  Who knew!
